				<p>I'm extremely excited to get started learning about Web Development here at Galvanize. Over the past few weeks I've really had a chance to realize how much I enjoy learning some of the things we'll master here: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc. I hope to be able to extend the skills I learn here so I can master other object oriented programming languages.

I'm also really excited to meet new people in my cohort and around Galvanize and network with some of the companies here on campus. My overall goal in life is to live a happy life with as little stress involved as possible; a philosophy or rule that I live by is to learn something from everyone, regardless of who they are or what they do.
