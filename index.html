				<p>Hello! My name is Rhys Goehring. I was born in Denver but only lived here for a few months before moving to Northern California where I lived just outside Berkeley until I came to Boulder in 2007. Previously, I was working in sales for tech companies like Xactly and TestPlant. At TestPlant, a company providing tools for automated software testing, I realized I needed to dive deeper into the technical side of things to understand and have better conversations with developers. This lead me to start learning some of the basics of object oriented programming; gradually, I realized I enjoyed development quite a bit more than sales and that it came much more naturally to me. After countless online tutorials which were either outdated or offered conflicting information on processes, I decided to look for somewhere to learn the right way - luckily I found Galvanize and immediately began the application process.

				<p> For fun, I enjoy exercise and spending time with friends and family as you can see in the picture above. I love doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, although I've taken some time off recently due to work and will be rarely practicing over the next six months to focus on my favorite new hobby: Web Development! I'm learning to become a full stack web developer at <a href="http://galvanize.com">Galvanize</a> in Boulder, Colorado starting January 30th,
					2017!
